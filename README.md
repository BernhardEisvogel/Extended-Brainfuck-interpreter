# Extended-Brainfuck-interpreter
This is a very simple playground for the Extended Brainfuck Programming Language (BFF) used in the paper "Computational Life: How Well-formed, Self-replicating Programs Emerge from Simple Interaction" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108. The goal is to play around with the self replicators. This project is an adapted and extended version of: https://github.com/James-P-D/BrainfuckBrowser

it is fully compatible with the usual Brainfuck language.

# Important!

In order to run a "traditional" BF program, the position of the read and write head on the tape has to be specified such that they don#t interact with the programming part.
